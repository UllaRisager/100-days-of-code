### Day 2: Oct. 24th 2017

**Today's Progress**: I can do this shit (just going through basic html again)

**Thoughts**: Taking time to code in the morning works way better than trying to rush it in the evening.

### Day 3:Oct. 25th 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went well, didn't code for 1 whole hour, but did 45 mins.

**Thoughts**: Wondering whether I should skip the basic html +css, but I feel like I need the review.
