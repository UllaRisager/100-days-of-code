### Day 8: Oct. 30th 2017

### Day 9: Oct. 31st 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Tribute Page, need to make it responsive. Starting this now: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage

**Thoughts**: I looked in the example code and he built it all in html and I did it with CSS and I don't know if that's ok? I still need to make it responsive, and it doesn't work with gridlex, don't really know how to do it and I tried asking in the forum, but didn't understand their replies, lol.
